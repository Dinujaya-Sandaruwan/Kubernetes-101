# Kubernetes 101

This repository contains documentation and examples for practicing Kubernetes tasks based on the engineer.kodekloud.com Level 1 Kubernetes Practice. Each task is aimed at building fundamental Kubernetes skills.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. Originally developed by Google, Kubernetes is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently, handling failover, scaling, and deployment seamlessly.

## What is KodeKloud?

KodeKloud is an online platform offering hands-on training for various DevOps and IT skills, including Kubernetes. It provides interactive courses and labs that simulate real-world scenarios, helping learners gain practical experience. KodeKloud's Level 1 Kubernetes Practice is designed to help beginners get up to speed with fundamental Kubernetes concepts and tasks.
