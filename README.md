# Kubernetes 101 [üëâüèª](https://github.com/dinethsiriwardana/Kubernetes-101/blob/main/Kubernetes/Welcome.md)

This repository contains documentation and examples for practicing Kubernetes tasks based on the [KodeKloud](https://www.kodekloud.com) Level 1 Kubernetes Practice. Each task is aimed at building fundamental Kubernetes skills.

## What is Kubernetes?

**Kubernetes**, often abbreviated as **K8s**, is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. Originally developed by Google, Kubernetes is now maintained by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/). It provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently, handling failover, scaling, and deployment seamlessly.
