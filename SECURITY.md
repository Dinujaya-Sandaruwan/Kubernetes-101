## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within our repository, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Privately** disclose the issue to us via email at [dinethsiriwardana28@gmail.com](mailto:dinethsiriwardana28@gmail.com). Please do not open GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

2. Provide us with sufficient details to reproduce the vulnerability, including steps or PoC (Proof of Concept) if possible.

3. Allow us a reasonable amount of time (typically 30 days) to respond to the issue before disclosing it publicly.

Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will acknowledge receipt of your report, outline the steps we are taking to mitigate the issue, and keep you informed until the vulnerability is fully resolved.

## Security Updates

We strive to promptly address any reported vulnerabilities. Updates and patches will be released as soon as fixes are validated and ready for deployment.

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. We kindly ask that you:

- Do not publicly disclose any vulnerabilities until we have addressed them.
- Avoid accessing or modifying data without explicit permission.
- Respect the privacy and integrity of our users' data.

By working together, we can ensure a secure environment for everyone using our Kubernetes practice repository.
