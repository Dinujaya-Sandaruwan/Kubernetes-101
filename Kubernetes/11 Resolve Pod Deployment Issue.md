The issue with the pod named `webserver` failing to start was due to a typo in the image name for the `httpd-container`. The image name was incorrectly specified as `httpd:latests` instead of `httpd:latest`. 

Here are the detailed steps taken to identify and rectify the issue:

1. **Check the Pod Status**:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    NAME        READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
    webserver   1/2     ImagePullBackOff   0          23s
    ```

2. **Describe the Pod** to get detailed information about the error:
    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod webserver
    ```

    Output showed the following:
    ```
    ...
    Containers:
      httpd-container:
        Container ID:   
        Image:          httpd:latests
        Image ID:       
        Port:           <none>
        Host Port:      <none>
        State:          Waiting
          Reason:       ErrImagePull
        Ready:          False
        Restart Count:  0
        Environment:    <none>
        Mounts:
          /var/log/httpd from shared-logs (rw)
          /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from kube-api-access-xnc7g (ro)
    ...
    Events:
      ...
      Warning  Failed     17s (x2 over 37s)  kubelet            Failed to pull image "httpd:latests": rpc error: code = NotFound desc = failed to pull and unpack image "docker.io/library/httpd:latests": failed to resolve reference "docker.io/library/httpd:latests": docker.io/library/httpd:latests: not found
    ```

    The key issue here was `Failed to pull image "httpd:latests": not found`.

3. **Edit the Pod Definition** to correct the image name:
    ```bash
    kubectl edit pod webserver
    ```

    Change:
    ```yaml
    image: httpd:latests
    ```

    To:
    ```yaml
    image: httpd:latest
    ```

4. **Verify the Pod Status** again to ensure it is running:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    webserver   2/2     Running   0          3m31s
    ```

    This shows that the pod is now in the running state, indicating that the application is accessible.

By correcting the image name, the `httpd-container` was able to pull the correct `httpd:latest` image, allowing the pod to start successfully.
